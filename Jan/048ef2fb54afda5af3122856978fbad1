Johannesburg -  ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says the organisation needs to deepen the impact of social and economic transformation. This he said during his opening remarks at the second part of the 55th ANC National Conference, which has reconvened in hybrid sessions at a number of venues in the country. Ramaphosa was re-elected as the party president last month after a battle with Dr Zweli Mkhize. “We are gathered at different venues across the country to receive the reports of the commissions that sat during the first part of the conference and to adopt the draft resolutions that were formulated to adopt the conference declaration,“ Ramaphosa said. ‘The Star’s’ sister publication, ‘Pretoria News’, reported that only the reports from the commissions and constitutional amendments would be discussed, according to ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula said the Phala Phala report would not be discussed when the conference resumed its business this week because it was not on the agenda. “There will be no Phala Phala report at the conference. We are entertaining two issues at the conference to finalise ... The reports from the commissions and then the constitutional amendments. That will be the business of the second leg of this conference. The issue of the Phala Phala report was brought to the national executive committee. There are important milestones in relation to this matter,“ he said. Ramaphosa also highlighted in his opening statement that there was an acknowledgement by the party of its weaknesses and the work required to correct them. “Our programme for this second part of the 55th National Conference will be intensive. It will be challenging to work across nine centres around the country to bring a conclusion to our conference. I call upon all of us to exercise patience as we seek to interact with each other as delegates on an online platform that in itself may give rise to challenges,” he said. The Star
