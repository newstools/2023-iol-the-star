Johannesburg - Sex ring kingpin Gerhard Ackerman, the man accused of more than 740 counts of crime, including rape, attempted murder, the production and distribution of child pornography, and human trafficking, did not make his appearance before the Gauteng South High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday. Ackerman’s lawyer, advocate Herman Alberts, told the court that his client is currently sick and thus could not make the court appearance on Thursday. According to Alberts, Ackerman is suffering from food poisoning and will be seeing a doctor later on Thursday, who will then advise on the severity of his condition. "Unfortunately, I received a voice note from my client informing me that he has had food poisoning. He told me that he is unable to get out of bed as he is very ill and very weak, and will therefore go to the doctor today. I also advised him that he must get a medical report with the date," his lawyer told the court. His case was subsequently postponed to Monday, with the second State witness set to begin his testimony. The witness, who was present at the court hearing, was told to return on Monday to find out if he could continue with his testimony. The 52-year-old Ackerman is accused of sexually exploiting young boys to perform sexual acts with adult men who would pay a fee, as well as participating in the rape of some of the boys while also encouraging them to have sex with Acting Judge Paul Kennedy, knowing that he was HIV-positive. It is reported that his co-accused, Kennedy, died by suicide last year while out on bail. On Wednesday, the court heard that Ackerman’s sex ring targeted a swimming pool in the area of Sunninghill and that some of his victims were minors at the time of the incidents. The Star
