Johannesburg - On Sunday, a 45-year-old man allegedly assaulted and killed his girlfriend and thereafter hanged himself in Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo.  The Provincial Commissioner of Police in Limpopo, Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe, has strongly condemned ongoing incidents of gender-based violence following the incident. Limpopo SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police were summoned to the scene at a house in Extension 133 at about 7am. On their arrival, they found the body a 41-year-old woman with bruises on her back lying inside the bedroom and that of her boyfriend hanging from the roof rafters in the passage.  “It is believed that the boyfriend assaulted his girlfriend until she lost her life and then hanged himself. The two bodies were only discovered in the morning by the two children aged 9 and 13,” Mojapelo said.  The deceased were identified as Rachel Madubanya (41) and her boyfriend Albert Mokgonyana (45). Police said the motive behind the incident is unknown at this stage but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. "We are very saddened by the incident and still urge community members who are experiencing domestic challenges to seek help immediately instead of resorting to violence," said Lieutenant-General Hadebe. Police have opened cases of murder and an inquest. Investigations are continuing. The Star
