Johannesburg - The police in Limpopo have condemned acts of gender-based violence after the gruesome murder of a 33-year-old woman who is believed to have opened a case of domestic violence against her husband before her lifeless body was discovered in a ditch. Police reveal that the 38-year-old suspect has been apprehended after the body of his wife was found in the water-filled pit toilet ditch in their yard at Mangodi Ha Sundou on January 28. The couple was reportedly in a rocky relationship, and as a result, the victim opened a case of domestic violence against her husband and he was arrested. “He was out on bail and was to appear again in Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court next week. The woman went to court on January 27 and withdrew the case. The suspect called the police this morning and indicated he could not locate his wife but was surprised to find her dead in the ditch in their yard. “A preliminary probe conducted by the police at the scene led to the arrest of the suspect on a charge of murder. “This is yet another incident of gender-based violence and femicide perpetrated against a vulnerable member of society. The woman obviously trusted her husband that he would not again physically torment her, but she is now no more. We urge community members having domestic challenges to seek help and desist from resorting to violence,” said Lieutenant-General Hadebe. The suspect is expected to appear in Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Monday, January 30. The Star
