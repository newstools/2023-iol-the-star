Johannesburg – Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) has confirmed that a car-hijacking incident took place near the King Shaka International Airport precinct on Tuesday night at around 11pm. According to Acsa, armed men hijacked a vehicle driven by the contracted security company after opening fire on the security guards, fatally injuring one. “Initial information received confirms that a contract security vehicle was hijacked while two security officers were doing patrols. The vehicle, riddled with bullets, has since been recovered after the hijackers abandoned it in Inanda, Durban,” said the state-owned enterprise. Acsa CEO Mpumi Mpofu has conveyed his condolences to the family members and colleagues of the deceased. “This is an unfortunate incident, and losing a life as a result of such lawlessness is especially painful. Our prayers and thoughts are with the family of the deceased. We will also be working very closely with the SAPS and all security agencies operating at the airport to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book,” Mpofu said. Acsa said the safety of passengers and staff was always a priority. “There are no interruptions to our operations. Acsa, at this stage, will not be releasing any further information that will compromise the ongoing investigation. Other details may be provided when possible and appropriate. The matter is currently being investigated by the SAPS,” read an Acsa statement. The Star
