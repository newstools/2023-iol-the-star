Johannesburg – The DA has commended the Gauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko for questioning the estimated cost of R18 million to fix the Tambo Memorial Hospital after it was damaged by the tanker explosion on Christmas Eve. “This amount was cited by Gauteng MEC for Infrastructure Development, Lebogang Maile, but his department is notoriously corrupt, and disreputable people may want to benefit from (repairing) the damage to the hospital,” said DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom.  “We saw this with greedy companies that profited from money earmarked for the Covid epidemic, including R500 million for alterations to the Anglo Ashanti Hospital on the Far West Rand which is now abandoned.” Bloom added that he would be monitoring the repair process to ensure that decent contractors repair the Tambo Memorial Hospital in good time and within budget.
