Joburg - The Randburg Magistrate’s Court was on Monday set hear an extradition case against an alleged kingpin wanted for kidnapping cases in Mozambique. The police announced on Sunday that a multidisciplinary team, led by members of the Trilateral Planning Cell (TPC) and Interpol, pounced on an upmarket estate in Centurion where they arrested an alleged kingpin wanted for kidnapping cases where ransom demands were made in Mozambique. The TPC is a structure that was established and is led by the ministers responsible for policing in South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania to counter transnational organised crime in the region. “On Saturday evening, the team, also consisting of the Special Task Force, Crime Intelligence, and Organised Crime, pounced on 50-year-old Esmael Malude Ramos Nangy at an identified address in Centurion, where he was arrested,” the SAPS said in a statement. “In his possession, the team seized a 9mm licensed firearm, fourteen 9mm cartridges, five cellphones, multiple bank cards for South African banks, as well as multiple SA and Mozambican SIM cards.” According to national SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe, the team was acting on a warrant of arrest and an extradition request by the government of Mozambique. “We received a warrant of arrest and an extradition request as early as July last year, where the Mozambique government indicated that there was a wanted suspect who could possibly be in the country,” Mathe told Newzroom Afrika. She added that the police worked tirelessly to apprehend the suspect. The police added that investigations would determine whether Nangy needed to be charged for being linked with any kidnappings in South Africa. The Star
