Johannesburg - A 60-year-old man from Lichtenburg, North West, was allegedly mauled to death by his three dogs on Saturday at around 3pm. North West police spokesperson Captain Sam Tselanyane said it is alleged that on Saturday during load shedding, the deceased’s wife was busy on the other side of their house when she heard the dogs barking. "She didn’t bother to go and check what was wrong as their house is situated on a busy street and the dogs are frequently barking at pedestrians and vehicles passing by. Moreover, after the electricity was restored, she allegedly went inside the house looking for her husband but could not find him," Tselanyane said. When the wife continued with her search, she saw her husband lying motionless outside in the garden. The police said she then quickly went outside only to find that her husband had been bitten by their dogs — two Staffies and pit bull crosses and one unknown breed dog. "Police and Emergency Medical Rescue Services (EMRS) were called, and the man was certified dead at the scene. The SPCA was also called, and the three dogs were removed from the premises," Tselanyane said. The incident comes on the heels of numerous reports of pit bulls mauling people to death, prompting calls for a pit bull ban in South Africa. The police confirmed that an inquest docket has been opened and an investigation into the matter continues. The Star
