Johannesburg - Gender-based violence (GBV) is looking like a continental problem, as according to an Afrobarometer survey, the scourge is the most important women's rights issue that Angolans want the government and society to address, with many citing it as a common problem in homes and communities. Afrobarometer is a pan-African, non-partisan survey research network that provides reliable data on African experiences and evaluations of democracy, governance, and quality of life. The survey found that half of Angolans say that a woman is likely to be criticised, harassed, or shamed if she reports gender-based violence to the authorities. "A majority of citizens say it is never justified for men to use physical force to discipline their wives, and most say gender-based violence is a criminal matter that requires the involvement of law enforcement authorities rather than a private affair that should be handled within the family," according to the survey findings. Other key findings highlighted that 23% of Angolans see gender-based violence as the most important women's rights issue, while 62% of citizens say violence against women and girls is a "somewhat common" (35%) or "very common" (27%) occurrence in their community. "More than two-thirds (69%) of Angolans say it is "never" justified for a man to use physical force to discipline his wife. Three in 10 consider it "sometimes" (20%) or "always" (9%) justified. About half (49%) of respondents consider it "somewhat likely" (23%) or Â "very likely" (26%) that a woman who reports GBV will be criticised, harassed, or shamed by members of the community. But a majority (59%) of citizens believe that the police are likely to take cases of GBV seriously," the survey found. Furthermore, 67% of Angolans say domestic violence should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a private matter to be resolved within the family. The Star
