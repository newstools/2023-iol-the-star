Johannesburg - ActionSA has congratulated Al Jama-ah councillor Thapelo Amad on his election as City of Johannesburg mayor with the support of ANC and EFF councillors and has vowed to be a constructive opposition within the council. In a statement, ActionSA expressed its disappointment at the breakdown of the DA-led coalition government and the consequent return of the ANC and its alliance, which again gained access to lucrative city tenders. As was the case in government, ActionSA said it would honour its mandate and continue to champion important service delivery priorities and fight corruption from the opposition benches. "We also congratulate our three ActionSA former MMCs on their tireless commitment to the people of Johannesburg, laying the foundation for a new era of clean governance and good quality services in the city which was unfortunately cut short,“ the party said. "The more than five million residents of the City of Johannesburg are desperate for service delivery within the city amidst bouts of load shedding and water shedding across the city while roads remain damaged due to December flooding. We urge Mayor Amad to prioritise these issues.“ ActionSA said it was committed to clean and ethical governance and the rule of law —core values of the party —and would continue championing these as a constructive opposition within the City of Johannesburg. Last week, Mpho Phalatse was voted out of office to make way for a new mayor from a coalition led by the ANC and minority parties. Phalatse’s fate was sealed on Thursday after she was voted out with 140 votes, while 129 others voted to keep her as executive mayor. The Star
