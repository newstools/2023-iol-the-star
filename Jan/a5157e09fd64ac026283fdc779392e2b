Johannesburg - Load shedding did not deter Khanyi Cynthia Mabunda from studying, and today she is one of the top 10 achievers for 2022 at the Nationwide School for Academic Excellence. Khanyi, who lives in Johannesburg, said her family were supportive. She said she worked really hard and was anxious to get her results. “I feel nervous because anything can happen, but I’m obviously hoping for the best. I am also excited because I will be opening a new chapter in my life,” said Khanyi. She said matric was a roller coaster of emotions. “My school was pushing us ... I made friends who also pushed me and were my competitors. I enjoyed being at school but was also tired and felt like it was too much, but eventually I became okay because my class teacher was there and so were my parents,” Khanyi said. One of the challenges Khanyi cited was load shedding. “Load shedding was a problem at first, but I got used to it and started using solar lights to study,” she said. Khanyi said when she wrote her preliminary exam for tourism, she got 190 out of 200, the second-highest mark in Johannesburg. “My biggest highlight was being able to overcome obstacles that I never thought I could,” she said. This year, she planned to study for an LLB at Wits University. “I’ve always wanted to be a lawyer. Not because I like the idea of it, but because I find passion in helping people and achieving justice.” She said wanted to work for the UN. Her advice for the matric class of 2023 is: “It will be hard, but they must hang in there.” The Star
