Johannesburg - Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu condemned the shooting incident where tourists were shot at by alleged poachers, aiming at animals, on the eastern shores of the Jozini Dam in KwaZulu-Natal, last week. It is believed that the tourists, identified as five Germans, two Americans, one Australian, and four South Africans, who were staying in a private lodge in the Pongola Dam Reserve, were on an Elephant River cruise when the incident took place. Though no one was harmed, Sisulu described it as an attack on the economy, as tourism played a significant role in the country's GDP. "Tourism creates thousands of jobs in the country, and these attacks are a direct attack on our economy." "South Africa and KZN is a safe destination for tourists, and incidents like these impact negatively on the reputation of our valuable tourism industry. We are working with law enforcement and other agencies to ensure the safety of tourists in the country," said Sisulu. According to the owner of the lodge, there were no injuries, although the tourists were traumatised by the incident. The tourists have since moved to another location. KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo said the rise in elephant poaching stemmed from community members' anger over the escalating incidents of human-wildlife conflict that led to the trampling of a resident in September 2022. Police spokesperson Robert Netshiunda explained: "Reports indicate that a group of people, including tourists, were on a wildlife sightseeing on a boat when unknown suspects started shooting at the animals. It is also reported that because they were being watched, the suspects allegedly shot randomly at the boat. No one was injured, and police are investigating." The police are investigating cases of attempted murder. The Star
