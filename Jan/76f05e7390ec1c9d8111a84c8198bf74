Joburg – Namibian President and current chairperson of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation Hage Geingob says that outgoing chairperson President Cyril Ramaphosa, although helpful to him when responding to questions, would sometimes take two days to get back to him. "I thank the outgoing chairperson, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, for his unwavering support and cooperation.  “He has always been available to take my calls and provide support. I will call him or leave a message... sometimes he takes two days to answer me but all the same he does reply," said Geingob. Geingob says he does understand that Ramaphosa is busy. "I do understand he is very busy; we all watched TV, so sometimes I’m surprised he even tries to answer and talk to me," he said. Geingob said this at the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Extraordinary Organ Troika Summit taking place in Windhoek, Namibia, while giving his opening address. The summit is convened to consider the peace and security situation in the SADC region. Ramaphosa will himself participate in the summit, according to a presidential statement. He will be accompanied by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor; the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Thandi Modise; and the Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele. According to the statement, it is expected that the extraordinary summit will consider the state of peace and security in the region, with a particular focus on the political and security situations in the Kingdoms of eSwatini and Lesotho, as well as developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Mozambique.
