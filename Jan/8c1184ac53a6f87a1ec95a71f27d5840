Johannesburg - The moment of truth is finally here. Sinenzuzo Dlamini is among the top 10 achievers at his school. Sinenzuzo is originally from KwaZulu-Natal and lives in Kensington, south of Johannesburg. He said he was very nervous and anxious, but excited to receive his results. He completed his Grade 12 year at the Nationwide School for Academic Excellence in Jeppestown last year. Sinenzuzo said his matric Class of 2022 was amazing. “It was filled with joy and support; we as a class supported one another, but mostly it was filled with a roller coaster of emotions,” Sinenzuzo said. He said the challenges he faced during the year were mostly not being able to pay school fees on time and his guardian not working. Sinenzuzo said load shedding also played a part in the challenges because he had to make his study schedule match the load shedding schedule, and they had to study at night. Sinenzuzo said the highlight was being able to spend time with his friends for the last time. “I was able to study with my friends and have fun along the way, but with my eyes on the prize. One of the achievements was that I received my June report card, which had outstanding marks, and I got to understand many topics that I didn’t know with the help of my teachers,” he said. Sinenzuzo’s plans for 2023 are to go and study medicine at the University of Pretoria or Wits University. “Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to study medicine and to study it at one of these best universities. My dream career is to be a doctor. Being a doctor has been my lifelong dream because I grew up in rural areas where people struggled to get the help that they needed, so this has made me want to help people get the health care that they need,” Sinenzuzo said. He said two people inspired him: his mother, Nelisiwe Dlamini, and his aunt, Sindisiwe Dlamini, who taught him to work hard and to be the best that he can be. The Star
