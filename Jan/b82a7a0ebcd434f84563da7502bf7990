Johannesburg - Scores of DA members have gathered at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown, where they are expected to march to the ANC headquarters in the Johannesburg CBD, Luthuli House. The march is due to the Eskom crisis, which has seen the country plunged into stages 3 and 4 of load shedding since the start of 2023. The party invited South Africans earlier this week to raise their voices against matters that are weighing down the state of the country. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. "On Wednesday, we will march to the ANC headquarters at Luthuli House against the ANC-engineered electricity crisis. I urge all South Africans to join us to voice their anger at the ANC’s destruction of our country’s energy infrastructure and economy and to demand urgent solutions to this escalating crisis." While it is all systems go in Johannesburg, DA member of Parliament, Natasha Mazzone has called for calm heads to prevail and for a non-violent protest as the DA prepares to march to Luthuli House. Mazzone has also pleaded with ANC supporters gathered at Luthuli House not to resort to violence today. She was speaking from Mary Fitzgerald Square, where DA supporters have gathered ahead of the march. DA shadow MEC of education, Khume Ramulifho says load shedding has badly affected the academic year across the province, as teachers often work fewer hours and find it difficult to continue with one-on-one learning. He says the march to Luthuli House is aimed at highlighting the impact load shedding has on the country's economy, including schooling. The Star
