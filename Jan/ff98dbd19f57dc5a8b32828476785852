Johannesburg - French football player and recent World Cup finalist Kylian Mbappé clocks speeds of about 35 kilometres per hour.

According to the newswire AFP, the French star, who missed out on another World Cup winner's medal after France lost to Argentina on penalties in Qatar, said he would never get over the disappointment of losing the World Cup final. "I think I'm never going to get over it," Mbappe said. Another top speed that was described as incredible by the company was that of Ghanaian star Kamaldeen Sulemana, who achieved a top speed of 35.7 kilometres per hour in the match against Uruguay, making him the fastest player in the group stages at the Fifa 2022 World Cup.

It’s a testament to their training and dedication that they can compete with the world’s best at such a high level," Reads said.
