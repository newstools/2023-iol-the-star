Pretoria - Free State police are on the hunt for three men who have been robbing filling stations in Mangaung, Bloemfontein. The suspects have been caught on CCTV footage on at least two occasions.  One of the videos shows two individuals allegedly robbing an Engen petrol station. They appear to threaten the filling station staff by pointing to an unidentified device in their possession, before they hand over a packet demanding cash in the till to be handed over. The same men were also caught on camera at a Shell station.
