Johannesburg - The serious findings arising from the auditor-general’s report for the 2021/2022 financial year are being considered by the governing multi-party coalition in the City of Tshwane. “From the outset, the multi-party coalition is unequivocal in expressing its disappointment with the audit findings and expects urgent remedial action, deep reform, and real accountability. Our efforts to displace failed ANC governance can never see regressions in the standards of good governance,“ said a multi-party statement. The statement further noted that the national structures of the multi-party coalition will meet with the executive team forming the Mayoral Committee in the City of Tshwane. “While every effort is made to localise coalition management, the national coalition structures must be briefed on the causal factors behind the audit findings as well as the measures that will be undertaken for remedial action,” added the statement. The parties said that while it can be said that the current multi-party government took over the reins at the Metro five months after the 2021/2022 financial year commenced and there are deep historical problems underpinning the report predating even that financial year, the multi-party government is nonetheless committed to address the historical root causes of adverse findings and hold those responsible accountable. “South Africans are looking to a grouping of political parties to provide an alternative to the failed ANC legacy of collapsing service delivery and rampant corruption. This is why the governing multi-party coalition in the City of Tshwane will respond to the auditor-general’s report decisively with remedial action, consequence management, and transparency,” added the statement.
