Johannesburg - With the death toll from the tragic Boksburg explosion rising to 37 people, Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi has said that they would continue to stand with the many families whose lives have been changed forever by the tragic incident. "This has not been an easy period, particularly for those who lost their loved ones," Lesufi said. He said that this has not been an easy period and assured the families of the deceased of the support of the provincial government. In a statement, the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) said although some families have already opted to bury their loved ones, national and provincial government officials will be deployed to attend the funerals of those who have not in order to "provide support to the affected families." "There is ongoing counselling to staff and their families and to the bereaved families offered by clinical psychologists, social workers, and chaplains. Where necessary, the government, working with organisations such as Gift of the Givers and AVBOB, has assisted with burial arrangements above other social relief measures offered to affected families," the GPG said. Lesufi reiterated his and the provincial governmentâ€™s condolences to those affected. The provincial government said eight Ekurhuleni Emergency Medical Services personnel were injured during the explosion, with six being discharged, while two have since been downgraded from intensive care to normal wards and are recovering well. The statement went on to say that services at the Antenatal Clinic, the Operating Theatre, the Outpatient Department, and Maternity Services have resumed, while repairs to other areas continue; those still affected include the accident and emergency unit, radiology, and clinical departments, including high-risk maternity services. "Contractors remain on site to work on the affected sections of the hospital with the aim to restore services as quickly as possible," read the statement. The Star
