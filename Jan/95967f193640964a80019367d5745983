Johannesburg - Edenvale residents have been on high alert today after reports confirmed that another tiger was on the loose. It was reported earlier that the tiger was spotted on CCTV footage roaming the parking lot of an office park in Edenvale, Gauteng, before it was swiftly recaptured and taken to a sanctuary for safekeeping. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee recently confirmed the recent developments in the capture of the tiger. This happened shortly after a tigress named Sheba also took to the streets, injuring a man and killing other animals in Walkerville, Johannesburg. After hearing the news about another tiger on the loose, the NSPCA called on the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to take responsibility for allowing domestication permits in residential areas. According to EWN, the NSPCA’s wildlife unit manager, Doug Wolhuter, said that becoming the owner of a tiger was surprisingly easy, at least in Gauteng, due to several legal loopholes and poorly implemented by-laws. “At this stage, we are telling residents if they do have animals, to keep their animals inside.” The animal protection organisation urged residents not to engage if they spotted the tiger. When Sheba was at the centre of the discourse, World Animal Protection shared insights about animal cruelty, revealing that wild animals are not pets and therefore should not be kept as such. “As World Animal Protection, we reiterate that wild animals are not pets and should not be kept as such. They have specific needs and behaviours that are difficult to meet in captivity. They are sentient beings and have wildlife rights. We call upon the Republic of South Africa, through the Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and Environment, to reconsider their captive wildlife policies and adopt laws that do not promote animal cruelty and exploitation, especially now when they are reviewing their lion-farming policies.” The Star
