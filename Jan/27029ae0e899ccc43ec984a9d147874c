Johannesburg - The DA has condemned the attempted murder of Eskom’s CEO, Andre de Ruyter, at Megawatt Park. According to the DA, De Ruyter has been left out to dry amidst ANC shenanigans, but now criminal syndicates within Eskom are palpably hell-bent on cementing their stranglehold on Eskom that is destroying the economy. “It is clear that they will stop at nothing. All this – worthy of a mafia movie – now plays out while the ANC does nothing to secure our electricity supply despite DA requests to take decisive action.  “Load shedding, rolling blackouts, continue to hobble the economy and have become an embedded feature in the daily lives of millions of South Africans," said the DA. "The DA calls on President Ramaphosa to outline to the nation exactly what is being done to address this mayhem?  “He needs to do so immediately and must be held to account for every act of omission or commission that has brought us to this sorry state of affairs." The DA said it will write to the president to demand action on this without delay. According to EE Business Intelligence, De Ruyter became ill, was weak, dizzy, and confused, shaking uncontrollably, and vomiting copiously before he subsequently collapsed, unable to walk, after drinking a cup of coffee in his office at Eskom Megawatt Park in Sunninghill. He was rushed to his doctor’s rooms by his security detail, where his condition was diagnosed as cyanide poisoning and treated accordingly.  Tests taken subsequently confirmed massively elevated levels of cyanide in his body. The Star
