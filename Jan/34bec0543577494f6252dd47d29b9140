Johannesburg – The death toll in the weekend mass shooting in Gqeberha, in the Eastern Cape, has risen to eight. It is reported that two men allegedly gunned down seven people, with the eighth victim dying after being rushed to hospital. Lieutenant General Nomthetheleli Mene, the Eastern Cape police commissioner, has since condemned the incident, in which another three people were injured. According to the police report, a preliminary investigation has revealed that between 5.15pm and 5.30pm, the owner of the house, who was celebrating his birthday, was gunned down by two unknown men who entered his home in Makanda Street, in Kwazakele. The assailants reportedly started shooting indiscriminately at the guests. Of those who were shot, seven (three women and four men) died at the scene, while another four people (two women and two men) were taken to the hospital. One of the victims died in hospital, bringing the death toll to eight. The owner of the house was among the dead. “Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects while an investigation into the circumstances surrounding this attack is under way. No arrests have been made at this stage,” Mene said. She said the victims still had to be identified. Mene said the Provincial Organised Crime Investigation unit was investigating. The commissioner appealed to the community to come forward with any information and not to harbour the criminals. “We will not rest until we find out what happened and who was responsible for these callous and cold-blooded attacks on these unsuspecting victims,” she said.
