Johannesburg - Limpopo police have finally arrested a suspect allegedly involved in the murder of a Limpopo businessman on Christmas Eve in 2020. On Friday night, a 36-year-old suspect in Soshanguve, near Pretoria, was arrested for the house robbery, kidnapping and murder of a 48-year-old businessman, Doctor Matea Ramatsemetse, in the early hours of December 24, 2020 in Ntoane village in the Dennilton policing area. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said Matea and his family had been asleep in their house in the early hours of Thursday, December 24, 2020 when three men had allegedly entered the home. "They demanded cash and, in the process, ransacked the house and took an undisclosed amount of cash and jewellery," Mojapelo said. "The suspects then tied up the victim’s wife and three children, and thereafter forced him into his Toyota bakkie and drove away with him. His body was found with bullet wounds in the area at 6am that morning. The vehicle was later found abandoned at Thambo View." Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe commended the team for arresting the suspect and urged community members to continue assisting the police in the fight against crime. The suspect is expected to appear in Moutse Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The Star
