Johannesburg – Ekurhuleni’s executive mayor, Tania Campbell, says various departments have been working tirelessly to ensure a thorough investigation to ascertain what happened and the way forward. Campbell was giving an update of the explosion that took place in Boksburg, where 38 lives have been lost to date. “I want to take this opportunity once again to pass on my sincere condolences to everyone who has suffered as a result of this tragedy, and offer my prayers to the families who have lost loved ones,” said Campbell. She also thanked the outpouring of support from civil society, NGOs, faith-based organisations, unions, residents, and other spheres of government. “Without you, our relief efforts would not have been as impactful as they have been.” “Since the day of the explosion, various departments in the City have been working tirelessly to ensure that a thorough investigation takes place to ascertain what happened on the day and the way forward,” Campbell said. She has had a meeting with members of her mayoral committee (MMCs), the Chief of Police, heads of department and senior officials to get feedback on what the status of the investigation is, she said. “I am pleased with the progress made in this regard and expect a final report to be presented to the mayoral committee this month, which will subsequently be presented to the council. “The City is exploring its legal options to act against both the company that owns the truck and the driver of the truck,” she said.  Campbell said they are of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence to charge them. More information is to be communicated in due course. “Once all investigations have been concluded, those responsible will be held to account,” the mayor said.
