The children are among 37 people who perished during the blast  that claimed lives of residents and 12 health-care workers stationed at Tambo Memorial Hospital. Speaking to the SABC on Christmas Day after losing her children, Rosetta Brits said her heart was in pieces. “All I can say is that it’s bad, I can’t say that I’m coping, my kids were my life, I was only living for my kids and now there’s only three left in my life. I don’t know if my heart will be all right, it’s in pieces,” she said. On Wednesday, Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi said eight Ekurhuleni Emergency Medical Services personnel were injured during the explosion.  “Six have been discharged, while two have since been downgraded from intensive care to normal wards and are recovering well.
