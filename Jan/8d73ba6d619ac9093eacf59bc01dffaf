On Thursday, the DA confirmed having filed  their court papers in their application to the High Court of South Africa for an interdict to stop the implementation of an 18.65% tariff increase by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). In its founding affidavit, in which the DA cites more than 20 respondents including the premiers of the country’s nine provinces, Eskom and the Minister of State Enterprises Pravin Gordhan, John Steenhuisen says the DA seeks interim relief pending the resolution an earlier relief sought to interdict the recent 18.65 tariff hike granted to Eskom by Nersa on a semi-urgent basis. Steenhuisen added that the DA rejected the tariff hike as it was too much to bear for South Africans still riddled by the effects of Covid-19 and other socio-economic ills. “The DA rejects this astronomical increase, we reject constant load shedding and we reject the government’s poor response – and President Cyril Rampahosa’s lack of response – to the biggest crisis our country has faced in the history of our democracy,” the party said. Steenhuisen said it has become apparent that the ANC leadership has failed to turn Eskom around and ensure reliable energy generation and provision. “It has become clear that government will not act in the interests of the citizens of this country, including protecting them from blackouts and unaffordable electricity tariffs, unless compelled by a court of law to do so,” he said.. This latest court bid by the main opposition party come just when the DA and its members are due to march to the ANC’s head quarters at Luthuli House in Johannesburg next week.  “In addition to our court action, the DA will march to Luthuli House on Wednesday, January 25. This ‘Power To The People’ march is directed at the ANC whose corruption and policy of cadre deployment is directly responsible for the energy crisis that we find ourselves in,” he said.
