Johannesburg - The Gauteng police department is making progress in recovering unlicensed firearms and ammunition. From January 1 to 11, the police in Gauteng seized about 3 103 unlicensed firearms and 2 904 assorted rounds of ammunition, including those that were voluntarily surrendered by the public. This is in an effort to fight the proliferation of unlicensed firearms. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the firearms were seized during different operations, which include the multidisciplinary Operation O Kae Molao, routine crime prevention patrols, stop-and-searches, and community tip-offs. The operations were conducted in partnership with other law enforcement agencies and relevant partners. Provincial commissioner of police in Gauteng, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, commended the seizures and urged the community to work with the police in the fight against crime. “Firearms are a weapon of choice in most crimes committed in Gauteng province, and it is important that they be removed from the wrong hands with the aim of protecting innocent victims,” said Mawela. The police added that all the recovered firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to establish any linkages to other serious crimes committed in the country. The Star
