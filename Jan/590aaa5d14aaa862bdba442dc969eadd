The Assembly of the Unemployed (AoU) says it strongly opposes the National Energy Regulator of SA’s (Nersa) decision to approve Eskom’s 18.65% electricity tariff hike, effective from April 1 amid increased rolling blackouts. The civil society organisation said that In June 2021, Eskom applied for a 32% tariff increase for the 2023/24 financial year and an additional 22.52% in 2024/25. “With more than 11 million South Africans being jobless, how on earth does Nersa think we will be able to afford such steep tariffs?  “The public should not have to pay for ongoing corruption, mismanagement and Eskom’s wasteful expenditure. Eskom must accept responsibility for its own problems and come up with alternative solutions,” read the AoU statement. AoU further noted that it was perplexing that Eskom is failing to repair and maintain its existing fleet despite the fact that people are paying exorbitant electricity rates only to be subjected to extended load shedding. “We need a fully transparent and participatory national dialogue around the energy crisis that we face in South Africa – with more environmentally sustainable, efficient and affordable energy options shaping that dialogue.  “The government must invest in more sustainable, efficient and affordable energy options like solar and wind power and do so with and through the public,” added AoU. The organisation called on communities, organisations, and individuals to make their voices heard by protesting and challenging both Nersa and Eskom.  “Eskom is stifling consumers, especially the poorest of the poor, who are barely affording the current rates.”
