Johannesburg - “Fly-by-night” colleges are synonymous with prospective students looking to gain a higher education at this time of the year, and Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Dr Blade Nzimande has warned both students and their parents to be careful of these illegal institutions. According to the department, these colleges are not registered as institutions of learning with the correct sector education and training authorities (Setas), the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) or other relevant bodies. Nzimande said that these institutions lure and mislead future students into believing that these colleges offer qualifications that are recognised by the SA Qualifications Authority (SAQA). “These illegal colleges offer compromised qualifications which are not recognised for employment purposes or for further study,” said Nzimande. He said that his department has been successful in shutting down these illegal operators, but there are still many students who continue to register and operators who unlawfully grant these fake qualifications. “The number of colleges that are operating illegally has decreased tremendously over the years. The decrease can be attributed to our monitoring awareness campaigns and our collaboration with both print and electronic media,” he said. Nzimande said the department was working closely with law enforcement agencies to shut down these colleges. He further advised students who want to enrol at private colleges to check the registration status of such private colleges with the department through its toll-free number, 0800 872 222. The Star
