Johannesburg - A 32-year-old University of Fort Hare (UFH) employee was found in his flat with his hands tied and mouth covered on Wednesday, according to police. SAPS say that they have opened a case of attempted murder. “According to reports, the victim was only noticed by his colleagues after he did not report at work. They then went to investigate in his flat, where they eventually found him. He was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for medical care after they noticed that he was not well. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are currently under investigation. No injuries were reported. A case of attempted murder has been registered for investigation. No arrest made at this stage,” read the statement. Earlier this month, UFH vice-chancellor, Professor Sakhela Buhlungu escaped an alleged assassination attempt while his executive bodyguard was shot dead in a hail of bullets. SAPS said the bodyguard was arriving at the home of the vice-chancellor, when an unknown vehicle with unidentified occupants approached. “The suspects started firing gunshots at the driver who succumbed to gunshot injuries at the scene. The vice-chancellor was not in the car at the time of the incident. The suspects later escaped in their getaway vehicle. Police have registered a murder case for investigation,” explained Eastern Cape SAPS spokesperson Tembinkosi Kinana.
