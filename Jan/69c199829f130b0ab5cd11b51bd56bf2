Johannesburg - After startling news reported the murder of Jennifer Motlhomi, 31, culminating in the arrest of her husband and ANC Member of Parliament, Sibusiso Kula, Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth, and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane says such acts will be met with the harshest opposition. She said that to have lawmakers who do not respect the rights and lives of women is unfortunate and must receive the harshest sentences. Kula was arrested in Klerksdorp on Friday and charged with the murder of Motlhomi. "In the North West alone, there are three other women who lost their lives at the hands of men, and we do not see the anger and uproar of every South African to eradicate this pandemic. “Women, children, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community are under attack in this country, and there is no corresponding power to stop this war as the numbers are increasing daily," she said. She noted that at the second presidential summit on gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) last year, emphasis was placed on the role of men as partners in ending GBVF, and that having a MP who should lead by example and reflect positive masculinities that should be instilled in all men and boys is essential, and that depicting the worst form of toxic masculinity must be condemned. She said that Kula’s arrest now affords the justice system an opportunity to demonstrate that if such violence is meted out against women and children, it will act swiftly and harshly to send a clear message to perpetrators, no matter what position they hold in society. "The law must take its course, but in cases of this nature, the justice system must show no mercy when sentencing the perpetrator. No one is above the law, and anyone who commits such heinous acts must receive harsh punishment for their crimes," Nkoana-Mashabane said. The Star
