Johannesburg - They may be gone, but their music and immeasurable contribution to the entertainment industry are the reason they continue to be remembered. The Hard Rock Café will take guests on a musical journey as they pay tribute to artists from the 1990s and 2000s who left a mark in the industry. This live experience will include local and international icons whose music will be ushering guests back to the good old days. In a conversation with The Star, managing director Catherine Dickinson spoke about the significance of the show, saying she wanted to bring back the live element after the pandemic. “One of the bases that our brand is all about is music, showcasing our band and artists and having that live element. Coming back from Covid, we had to adapt our business model to tune our budget. And we were finally in a space where we could bring back that live element, however, with a bit of a twist. So what we are looking to do is pay tribute to both South African as well as international artists that had influence in the 1990s and the 2000s. “Focusing on female artists in particular, we have a vocalist and a DJ who will be curating the songs that will be sung, and we will still have that live element in place,” said Dickinson. She said there were some powerful woman singers who came to the fore during that period. It is also International Women's Month in March. “We thought for our first one, let's give the women the stage.” Asked how they chose which artists to feature, she said: “We were looking at artists that made an impact, especially within those two eras, and artists that are relatable to the South African audience. Some of the tributes that we will make are for legendary artists like Brenda Fassie and Boom Shaka, and we will have a couple of songs from Mary J Blige.” The show takes place at the Hard Rock Café in Johannesburg tonight.
