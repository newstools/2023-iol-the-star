City of Ekurhuleni service providers were caught red handed doing shoddy work instead of professionally repairing potholes. Two officials who did not identify themselves were busted by “The Star” news team committing a crime against the community of Ext 2 Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, by Morubisi Street, which is between a primary school and a high school.  Morubisi Street and other surrounding streets have been plagued with potholes since last year and community members were subjected to driving over and around them. Driving down the street, the two officials looked like they were doing their work until we came closer to investigate. The pothole had been filled with what looked like asphalt patch materials, then the truck branded with Ekurhuleni Municipality was seen driving back and forward in an attempt to flatten the surface, As soon as the reporter questioned the driver, he dashed off, leaving another official who was standing on the side carrying protective gloves. The reporter asked him if this was the correct method to repair potholes. He replied: “We are working under Ekurhuleni Municipality. After 30 minutes this surface will become flat, cars will drive over it and it will become flat.  “The municipality does not have a tamper, equipment used to flatten the surface. The municipality does not have material, so we are doing a temporary job for the safety of locals,” said one official. The City of Ekurhuleni said they would investigate the matter. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
