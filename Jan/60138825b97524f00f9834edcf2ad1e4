Johannesburg – A security company owner appeared in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court yesterday over (Friday) the alleged possession of hijacked vehicles that were used in the attempted cash-in-transit robbery that took place on Tuesday near Boipatong, the Hawks said. "The incident took place along Frikkie Meyer Street, facing Sebokeng. A G4S armoured vehicle was allegedly rammed from behind twice by a charcoal Mercedes Benz. The driver veered off the road into the nearby bushes.  “Shots were allegedly fired at the armoured truck. A group of armed suspects surrounded the stuck truck and instructed the guards to alight," said a Hawks statement. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the guards were disarmed of their firearms and the suspects tried to blow up the armoured vehicle with explosives without success. "They sped off the scene empty-handed using several vehicles. A crack team led by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime, Sedibeng Crime Intelligence, Tactical Response Team, and K9 was established. On Thursday afternoon, the team pounced at an address along Fowler Street in Vanderbijlpark," added Ramovha. According to the Hawks, two vehicles, a white Audi A3 and a blue Hyundai Tucson suspected of having been used as getaway vehicles, were recovered from the address. "Further investigation led to the confiscation of six 9mm pistols, bullet-proofs and reflective jackets," said the Hawks. The Star
