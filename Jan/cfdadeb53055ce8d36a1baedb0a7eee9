Johannesburg â€“ The battle for the leadership of the City of Johannesburg will continue today at the Metro Centre in Braamfontein, where Mpho Phalatse is expected to be removed as mayor after a year at the helm. Phalatse is expected to be voted out of office through a motion of no confidence by the opposition bloc and some of her own party members who have lost faith in her leadership. The DA-led multiparty coalition was depending on the Patriotic Alliance (PA) to save Phalatse from being removed as mayor. But talks broke down, and the PA was now expected to vote with the ANC-led opposition. ActionSA leaders who had led the talks between the PA and the multiparty coalition accused the DA of throwing Phalatse under the bus and allowing her to be removed through a motion of no confidence. Some DA councillors had been given the freedom to vote against Phalatse without suffering the consequences after the fact. Phalatse was expected to hold a media briefing today morning on matters concerning City Power. Some people close to the mayor have said she was likely to join ActionSA after the motion of no confidence. The Star understands that the rift between Phalatse and the DA leadership was part of an elective conference that will take place this year. The Star
