Johannesburg - The National Commissioner of the SAPS, General Fannie Masemola, commended a joint intelligence-driven operation for the swift arrest of three men in Kliptown following the murder of a police sergeant on Christmas Day.  National police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said the suspects, aged 30, 25 and 22, were arrested during a raid on three identified premises in Kliptown on Friday, December 30. “A preliminary investigation into the incident indicates that 41-year-old Sergeant Phillip Mathlaela was shot and killed while parked on a bridge in Kliptown. His body was then dumped into a river,” Mathe said.  The police said the motive of the attack and killing of the off-duty police officer is under investigation.  “The police officer’s belongings, including two cellphones, his vehicle and its key, were found on the scene, ruling out robbery as a motive for the attack,” Mathe said.  “General Masemola has condemned the attack and killing of members both on and off duty and says police will continue to bring to book those behind the heinous attacks and killing of police officers.” The three men were charged with murder and for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. They will appear before the Kliptown Magistrate’s court on Tuesday. The Star
