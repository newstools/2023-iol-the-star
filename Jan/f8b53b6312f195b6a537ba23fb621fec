Joburg - A Piet Retief, Mpumalanga councillor, identified as Sbonelo Mthembu, 36, as well as two other men were gunned down on Friday at around 8pm. The provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Daphney Manamela, strongly condemned the fatal shooting incident at Longhomes, where 36-year-old councillor Sbonelo Mthembu and two other men were gunned down. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Donald Mdhluli said according to the report, the three were shot at a certain yard in Mkhondo. “Further information indicates that the councillor as well as his mechanic were dropped off by a friend who was driving a bakkie when suddenly three armed men appeared in the yard. The suspects reportedly fired multiple shots at the councillor, who was in the yard, and also fatally shot his friend, who was still inside his bakkie. The mechanic did not escape the shooting, as he was shot by the same suspects while in the yard as well. Thereafter the three suspects fled,” Mdhluli said. The SAPS said the police in Piet Retief as well as the paramedics were informed about the incident, while the councillor and his mechanic were taken privately to a nearby hospital. The mechanic was unfortunately certified dead on arrival, while the councillor succumbed to his injuries moments later. “When police and medical practitioners arrived at the scene, they found a male victim lying motionless behind the steering wheel of a white bakkie with a gunshot wound. The paramedics certified him dead at the scene. A case of three counts of murder was opened, and the suspects are still at large,” Mdhluli said. The police said a dedicated team of experts in the field of investigation was immediately assembled under the leadership of Manamela to probe this disheartening incident with the anticipation of swiftly bringing the perpetrators thereof to book.
