Johannesburg - Limpopo police have arrested a suspect for allegedly attempting to kill sisters after being released from prison for violation of a protection order. On Friday, a 34-year-old suspect from Levubu outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, who attempted to kill his alleged ex-girlfriend, 30, and her younger sister, 28, after he was sentenced for violation of a protection order obtained against him by the same ex-girlfriend, was arrested following an extensive search by the local detectives. "The suspect, Matimba Goodman Mahlaule, was initially arrested on November 7 last year and his first court appearance in Levubu Magistrate's Court was on November 9. He was then remanded in custody until November 21 for further police investigation," Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said. Mojapelo said the accused appeared in court before the remanded date and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment or a R10 000 fine. Mahlaule managed to pay the fine and was released on November 28 last year. "After he was released, he allegedly went to the place where his ex-girlfriend resides in Tshakhuma village and hacked both sisters with an axe," Mojapelo said. A case of two counts of attempted murder was then opened, and the police started a search operation for the suspect, who was ultimately arrested on Friday at about 3:30 p.m. after he handed himself over to the police. "The suspect is expected to appear before the Vuwani Magistrate's Court on Monday, January 9, 2023, facing two counts of attempted murder. Police investigations continue, Mojapelo said. The Star
