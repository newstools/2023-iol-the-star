Johannesburg - A 57-year-old businessman, Michael Chimanzi, has been sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for defrauding Eskom of more than R2.6 million. The NPA said he was charged along with his two co-accused, Nwabisa Ngxola and Cinderella Moropane, both of whom were employed by Eskom as finance clerks. “The duo’s defence representation applied for the separation of trials, which the court granted. The trio was convicted of fraud, theft and money laundering, and the case against them was postponed to May 2, 2023, for sentencing proceedings in the same court," said NPA regional spokesperson Monica Nyuswa. She said the trio worked together to submit fraudulent invoices to Eskom. Ngxola’s password and username were used to capture certain payments to Mandla Lines CC, which is a legitimate company registered in Chimanzi’s name. “They shared the proceeds amongst themselves, and the accused were arrested after the police received a tip-off,” said Nyuswa. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Cape, former ANC regional secretary Tembalethu “Terris” Ntutu and 17 businessmen and members of the Mnquma Municipality Bid Adjudication Committee are due to appear in the Mthatha High Court on fraud and corruption charges. “The charges relate to the irregular awarding of contracts and gratifications for a R24 million turnkey electrification project and a further R10 million awarded to Big Boy Events for the supply and delivery of cleaning equipment,” said the prosecuting authority.
