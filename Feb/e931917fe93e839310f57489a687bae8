"If you find yourself in flooded areas, move towards high-lying and safe places. Don't attempt to swim as the water flowing is very strong, or attempt to rescue someone if you can't swim or if the water is flowing fast. Don't try to save your belongings, as your life is more precious." The continued flash floods caused by heavy downpours have ravaged many parts of the country, leaving many without homes. Last week, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) warned the Gauteng province of heavy downpours, putting out an orange level 5 alert. According to the models, heavy rainfall (50-80 mm) could cause flooding of roads and settlements. The SA Weather Service also revealed that inclement weather conditions could pose a threat to life due to fast-flowing streams. Among the areas that experienced severe flooding were most parts of the Eastern Cape, the central and eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the Lowveld of Mpumalanga, the eastern and northern parts of Limpopo, the central and eastern parts of the Free State, Gauteng, as well as the extreme eastern and north-eastern parts of the North West.
