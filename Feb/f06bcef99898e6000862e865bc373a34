Johannesburg - The Free State Department of Education says it has noted with concern the alleged incident of corporal punishment administered last week by the principal of Ntsu Secondary School in Bethlehem, Thabo Mofutsanyana District. The department said it condemned in the harshest possible terms the alleged use of corporal punishment against any learner. “Corporal punishment has been banned and may not be used as a method of enforcing discipline in schools. “Principals, educators, learners, parents, and/or any support staff are required to report the use of corporal punishment following the prescripts contained in the Protocol to Deal with Incidences of Corporal Punishment in Schools,” read a department statement. The provincial department said that harsh action would be taken against anyone who violated the prohibition on corporal punishment. “Images depicted on various social media platforms indicate that the Ntsu Secondary School principal used corporal punishment as a way to discipline a learner who reportedly failed to comply with the detention sanction conditions at school. “Corporal punishment is a violation of children’s rights, physical integrity, dignity, health, development and education,” said the department. The department said it had commenced an investigation into the incident and would work with urgency to establish the facts. Last week in the province, “The Star” reported that a 56-year-old bus driver had been arrested and was due in court after he was caught on camera allegedly assaulting a 17-year-old boy. The assault, which took place in full view of other pupils, all of them in school uniform, was filmed via a cellphone camera. In the clip, the pupil is seen boarding the bus. The driver gets up from his seat. Using his leg and arms, he tries to push the boy out of the bus. The teenager says something to the driver and refuses to leave the bus. The Star
