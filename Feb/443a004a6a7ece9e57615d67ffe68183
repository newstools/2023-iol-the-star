Johannesburg - Fidelity ADT has warned homeowners that there is a new trend emerging, where criminals are targeting solar panels. "As criminals continue to shift and change their patterns and behaviours, it is essential that homeowners keep up with trends and better ways to secure their homes," said Charnel Hattingh, Group Head of Marketing and Communications at Fidelity ADT. Fidelity ADT said that more homeowners are making investments in energy-efficient devices as a result of the energy crisis, which has attracted thieves. Targeting solar panels by thieves is a recent development. "Over the past few weeks, we have received reports of solar panels being stolen from properties, typically during the day while homeowners are at work," said Hattingh. The company added that in order to stay one step ahead of opportunistic criminals, it is important to make your home less of a target by making it as hard as possible for criminals to successfully carry out their plans on your property. Hattingh offers these safety tips: Fidelity ADT said that homeowners must remain vigilant and not leave anything to chance. In addition, it is vital that all incidents are reported timeously to the police so that they can be logged as crime statistics. "Crime statistics help the police strategise and allocate the appropriate resources to suburbs, in conjunction with private security companies and other stakeholders, to protect lives by better managing crime, curbing trends, and equipping the justice system," said Hattingh.
