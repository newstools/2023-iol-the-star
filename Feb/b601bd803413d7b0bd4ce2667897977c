Johannesburg - New Johannesburg Mayor Thapelo Amad today announced eight members of his Mayoral Committee (MMCs) after being sworn in on Monday. According to a city statement, the new MMCs were selected after extensive consultations with other political parties, with the aim of solidifying the Government of Local Unity (GLU) partnership in the city. The executive mayor indicated that he intends to appoint two more individuals to his Mayoral Committee tomorrow, once they have been sworn in as councillors, in order to draw from the pool of skills that exist outside of council. "The new mayoral committee is tasked with ensuring the acceleration of service delivery in the City of Johannesburg," said a City of Joburg statement. Amad said that he urged the new city senior management team to work with the GLU in a cohesive and integrated manner. "We must work together for and with our residents. We further urge senior management to instil professionalism and increase productivity that is performance-driven," said Amad. He added that for the city to achieve its goals, there must be alignment between the GLU mandate and government programmes (IDP, SDBIP) as informed by the Growth and Development Strategy (GDS) 2040. "Our city has lost a lot of time due to indecisive leadership over the past few months. It is time for us as the Government of Local Unity to get back to the basics and serve our residents," said Amad.
