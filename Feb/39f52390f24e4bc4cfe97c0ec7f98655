Johannesburg â€“ The National Freedom Party (NFP) has sent its condolences to the families of the victims and all those affected by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck southern Turkey and the north-western parts of Syria earlier today.  Latest reports indicate the powerful quake has killed more than 2 000 people, injured thousands more and toppled hundreds of buildings.  In a statement, the NFP said it stands in solidarity with the international community in this time of tragedy and sends its thoughts and prayers to those impacted by this disaster. The party said it was grateful for the efforts of the rescue teams that are working to search for survivors and provide aid to those in need. NFP parliamentary leader Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam said the party was deeply saddened by the devastating news of the earthquake. "As South Africans, we know all too well the pain and heartache caused by natural disasters, and we extend our support to the affected communities during this difficult time," said Shaik Emam. The NFP has also called on the international community to provide all necessary aid and support to those affected by this disaster. This follows a recent earthquake in the same region that affected the Islamic Republic of Iran, resulting in large-scale destruction as well as the loss of lives and a large number of injured people on January 28, in the city of Khoy, in north-west Iran. The World Medical Association (WMA) has sent a message of support to earthquake physicians. "A message of sympathy and support for physicians and other health personnel deployed to the earthquake disaster areas in Turkey and Syria," it said. "Our thoughts are with all those affected by the disaster. It is vital that emergency medical aid is immediately dispatched to the region," said Dr. Frank Montgomery, chair of the WMA council.
