Cape Town - Teams from Johannesburg City Power  continued to disconnect electricity to residents and businesses with outstanding utility bills in Midrand on Monday. Some of the places disconnected included the Silver Stream residential complex, which owed over R9m and a car dealership in Randjespark which owed over R4m. Joburg City Power condemned unscrupulous landlords whose actions have left paying tenants across Midrand in the dark. City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena, said several businesses, mainly residential complexes around Midrand that have failed to settle a combined electricity bill of R37m were disconnected on  Monday. “This is part of City Power's rigorous, thorough and ongoing revenue collection drive implemented across the City. More than R340m is owed by businesses and individuals in Midrand.”  He said areas that were disconnected as part of the operation included: Mangena added that City Power is beginning to realise gains made from running these operations with close to R4billion already collected across the City since October.  The entity is still owed about R7.9bn by customers across the city. “We encourage customers who are in arrears or know they have defaulted to approach our Service Delivery Centres across all regions so that arrangements can be made as we regard these operations as the last resort,” Mangena added. #MidrandCutOff #JoburgUpdates #RegionA And just like that, Franklin on 8th is out.
