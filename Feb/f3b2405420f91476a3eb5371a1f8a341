Johannesburg - The Gauteng police announced on Tuesday that members from various units arrested the driver of a suspiciously marked SAPS vehicle in Rabie Ridge. SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said that preliminary investigations revealed that the vehicle was stolen in Bedfordview in December, and it is believed that the vehicle was being used to commit truck hijackings. "On Monday, February 27, 2023, at around 1pm, members of Ekurhuleni District Crime Intelligence, Trio Task Team, Tembisa Tracing Team, and Highway Patrol Unit acted on a tip-off regarding a suspiciously marked South African Police Service vehicle in the Rabie Ridge area," Masondo said. "Information was followed whereby a Mazda BT50 resembling a SAPS Provincial Head Office vehicle was intercepted while driving out of a plot in Midrand, Modderfontein Road." The police said that the driver managed to flee the scene, but he was pursued and apprehended. "While the police were busy at the crime scene, a man arrived and requested the members to release the suspect, offering them R5000 as bribery. The 46-year-old was immediately placed under arrest for bribery," the SAPS said. The suspects will appear in court soon, according to the police. The Star
