Joburg - The controversy over the R910 million Tottenham Hotspur sponsorship deal has resulted in three SA Tourism board members quitting their positions at SAT. Last week, the Daily Maverick reported that SAT was on the verge of agreeing to a R910m sponsorship deal with the English Premier League side. South Africans reacted negatively to the news, with President Cyril Ramaphosa having also weighed in, saying plans by the SAT agency were not justified in the midst of an energy crisis in the country. “We do not think spending so much money in the manner that is being suggested will be justified, and the president has not been briefed on the matter,” presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said. The controversy arising from this botched deal has since resulted in Tourism CEO Enver Duminy, Ravi Nadasen and Rosemary Anderson resigning with immediate effect. SAT board chairperson Aubrey Mhlongo thanked the three members of the board for their services, with Minister of Tourism Lindiwe Sisulu having accepted the resignations. This comes after Mhlongo appreciated the service of Duminy, Nadasen, and Anderson, who resigned from the South African Tourism Board effective immediately. “As the board, we extend our sincere gratitude to Enver Duminy, Ravi Nadasen and Rosemary Anderson for their invaluable contribution to the South African Tourism Board during their tenure, and we wish them well in their future endeavours. “Resulting from a difference of opinion, Nadasen and Duminy’s resignation (effective February 2) and Anderson’s resignation (effective February 3), were tendered to Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and South African Tourism board chair Dr Aubrey Mhlongo,” the board said in a joint statement. On Thursday, during a media briefing held at Bojanal House in Sandton, acting SA Tourism CEO Themba Khumalo said: “The deal would see a good return on investment as it would result in 80 times more than its value over a three-year period.” The Star
