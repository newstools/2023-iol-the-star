GDoH's head of communication, Motalatale Modiba, said that there are 52 cases from the Ekurhuleni district, seven from the Johannesburg district, 11 from the Tshwane district, four from the West Rand district, and none from Sedibeng. "To date, we have been able to immunise over 1 136 866 children across the province. We continue to urge parents and caregivers to continue cooperating with the campaign in terms of giving consent for their children to be immunised at schools," Modiba said. "Parents with little ones who are not yet at early childhood development centres or schools can take them to their local clinics for immunisation."
