Johannesburg – The Limpopo police have launched a manhunt after a 34-year-old man was shot execution-style in front of his gate on Wednesday.  Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe said the man was killed outside his home in Ntwane Maswikaneng village on Wednesday.  Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim had arrived home just after midnight when he was shot at point-blank range in front of his gate. “Police members on patrol duties responded to a complaint of shooting incident and on arrival at the scene they found the victim in a pool of blood inside his motor vehicle, a Toyota Avanza,” Mojapelo said. According to the police, the victim was shot several times. “These killers must be hunted down until they are caught and brought to book,” said Hadebe. “This incident has clearly sent cold waves to the local community and I want to assure everyone that the police are doing everything to find the killers.”  Police are appealing to anyone who might have information that can lead to the arrest of the suspect(s) to contact Lieutenant Colonel Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501 or Warrant Officer Phaladi Makola at 082 749 2233, the Crime Stop number 08600 10111, the nearest police station or send information via MySAPSApp. The Star
