Johannesburg - The Gauteng Legislature’s Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts, Culture, and Recreation has conveyed heartfelt condolences to the Moeti family following the passing of Bafana Bafana midfielder John "Dunga" Moeti. In a statement, the committee said that the legend was part of the indomitable national squad of 1995 that was coached by Clive Barker, and among other landmark victories, the side made waves by winning the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).
