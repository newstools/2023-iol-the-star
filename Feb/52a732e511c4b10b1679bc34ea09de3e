Johannesburg – The Phokeng Regional Court today sentenced Thabo Ernest Nkoane to life imprisonment for murdering his mother, Peggy Nkoane, and burning her remains inside their home. The victim was a primary school teacher. The murder took place at Buanja Lefaragatlha village, near Phokeng, North West, on December 22, 2017. "Nkoane murdered his mother by chopping her into pieces before burning her remains," said NPA North West spokesperson Henry Mamothame. He said neighbours and friends of the victim were surprised by her prolonged absence from work and church. They were also shocked by the smoke that came out of the tiled roof of the house on the day she was murdered. Mamothame said the matter was reported to the police, who discovered the woman’s burnt remains on December 26, 2017. Nkoane was arrested and charged with premeditated murder. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was denied bail. Mamothame said the state prosecutor, Obed Molope, urged the court not to deviate from the minimum prescribed sentence of life imprisonment. Magistrate Segakweng Moeng agreed with the State, saying that Nkoane was not a candidate for rehabilitation as he was cold-blooded, arrogant and remorseless. The Director of Public Prosecutions in the North West, Rachel Makhari Sekhaolelo, lauded the investigating officer, prosecutor, and all the role players who contributed towards this conviction.  “We laud the members of the community for their role in the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator. We need such advocacy in our communities in the fight against crime,” said Makhari. The Star
