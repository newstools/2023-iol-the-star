Johannesburg -- THE Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) confirmed a shooting incident that took place at Kagiso Senior Secondary School on Friday.  GDE spokesperson Steve Mabona said on Saturday morning that according to information at the department’s disposal, it is alleged that an unknown man gained access into the school through the main gate when it was remotely opened for a car to drive in.  “The patroller responsible for manning the gate tried to stop him but he did not cooperate. He proceeded to the admin block and hysterically demanded to see the principal,” Mabona said.  The unknown man was told that the principal was in a meeting and therefore could not see him at that time. “He allegedly drew a knife and stabbed a teacher, in the hand. Subsequently, another teacher allegedly fatally shot him. Police are investigating circumstances surrounding this incident,” the spokesperson added.  Kagiso Police spokesperson Capt Solomon Sibiya told Krugersdorp News that the staff was in a meeting in the staff room when the suspect entered. “He allegedly held the staff hostage while wielding a knife,” Sibiya said. The Kagiso police are investigating the incident and have opened an inquest docket. The department said the learners convened in the school hall and addressed but were later released because they became restless. The GDE Psycho-Social Unit will be dispatched to the school on Monday to offer counselling to all the affected learners and teachers. The Star
